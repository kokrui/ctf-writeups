Assigned Writeups
---
As part of winner validation, there are mandatory write-ups for 2 challenges. We were assigned [SOAR]() and [Easy SQL](https://github.com/kokrui/ctf-writeups/tree/master/DSO-NUS%20CTF%202021/Web/Easy%20SQL).

These were originally written on a Google Doc, because I wrote them on mobile while in an army camp.
